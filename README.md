#2048

A mobile game for smartphones with Android or iOS made by me on Xamarin.Forms.
I was also using ReactiveUI Framework for implementing MVVM pattern.

This Project was a great opportunity for me to refresh my knowledge about Xamarin and to get me more familiar with MVVM.

Development of this project was also a chance for me to practise writing Unit Tests.
I wrote them using NUnit Framework and NSubstitute library.
